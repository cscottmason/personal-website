        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello! My name is Candice and I am a beginner web developer. I have always
            been interested in the creation of websites since I learn about HTML and 
            a bit of Javascript in highschool. Fast forward, I was presented with the 
            oppurtunity of a lifetime when my job, Amazon, offered to pay for schooling 
            in Software Development! Even though I am only just starting, I have learned
            so much and look forward to continuing my education and starting a career as
            a Front End developer.

        </p>

        <h1>So What's Next?</h1>
        <p>After I complete the Software Engineering Cohort at FlatIron School, I am looking
            to start a career as a Front End Software Engineer I will continue to perfect my 
            skills in my past time while also learning new techniques and technologies along 
            the way. (Maybe even some backend technologies) I eventually plan to also do freelance 
            work on the side, making websites for small busnesses.
